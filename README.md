# Data-Engineering-Projects

Welcome to my **Data Engineering Portfolio**, a collection of hands-on projects that demonstrate my ability to design, build and manage data workflows.  

These projects are built primarily in **Python** and **SQL**, with a focus on automation, scalability and transforming raw data into structured, usable datasets.
